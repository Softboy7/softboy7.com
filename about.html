        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hey, I'm Softboy7.</p>
        <p>If you want to know more about me and the lore of my music,<br>this is the right place.</p>
        <p>
I love creating.<p>
        <p>
Making something is the best. Like even drawing a stick figure with a cool hat.
You made something!
Just like
<p>HOW COOL IS THAT<p>
<p> </p>
It didn't exist but then you had an idea in your head and brought it into the real/digital world.

<p>When it comes to music and everything around it, it's the same thing, just more complex.
I take inspiration from very emotional real life situations and merge them with ultra specific aesthetics that I'm obsessed with.
All of my albums follow storylines and visions that I create from scratch. </p>
          <p>
<p> Of course, my music is for everyone who wants to listen, but I strongly sympathize with outcasts and lonely people because I think the feeling of not fitting in is so relatable. 
Being different is not a bad thing, tho. It means you held onto something that many lose throughout life: your curiosity, your fantasy-like imagination, your courage to be yourself.
<br>I think that's something to be proud of.
  
<p>With all that being said... I ain't no company or businessman who chases mass appeal. I'm just a guy, independent, DIY asf, often in his pajamas converting feelings into music.
<br> I'm really grateful I get to do that, fr ♡
<p> LORE:
<br> The "welcome to the void" lore is up on my Discord server but I don't recommend reading it if you're under 16.
<br> As for the dreamData lore, I want to wait before publishing it. I want to give people the chance to connect their own feelings and stories to it.
All I can say is: it's a very personal project, and I’m super proud it’s finally coming out. I worked on it for over 1.5 years.
 <br> ♡♡♡
